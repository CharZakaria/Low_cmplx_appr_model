# A Low-Complexity Convolutional Neural Network-based Approach for Vehicle Detection

In this project, we propose a framework to reduce the complexity of CNN-based AVS methods. 
For more detail, please read our Paper titled : " A Low-Complexity Convolutional Neural Network-based Approach for Vehicle Detection "

To use it : 

<h2> 1 - 
<h6>  Create as much of clusters as you need regarding your application. <\br>
<h3> hint : <h6> start by defining the appropriate input shapes for your application
<h2> 2 - 
<h6>  Download the YoloV3/tiny-Yolov3 weights and put them into :  ./cluster_{i}/model_data
<h2> 3 - 
<h6>  Set the classes you want to detect at : ./cluster_{i}/model_data/{your_classes}.txt
